Our project is going to be a 3D maze game using facebook.
<br>
It will use parts of the Facebook API (getting wall posts, friendlists, etc.) and Oauth.
<br>
The game will be multiplayer through a server.
<br>
The goal of the game will be to traverse the maze without being shot by other players.
<br>
If a player is shot, the player will return to the start
