Our project is going to be a 3D visualization of Facebook.
<br>
It will use parts of the Facebook API (getting wall posts, friendlists, etc.) and Oauth.
<br>
The plan is to project the different things on the website into 3D rooms you can interact with (eg. chats will be rooms you can walk into and talk to people).
<br>
The goal is that all your interactions in this 3D environment will transfer onto the actual Facebook site.
